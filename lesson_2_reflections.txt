What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When I initialize a repozitory .git directory is created in the folder with other files. 
  We need it in order to use Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area offers an opportunity to choose from the files which we'd like to commit. Add them to the staging 
  area or remove if needed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  Using command git diff --staged we can compare changes that was made in files to the same files in the last commit.
  If these changes are logically enough to be commited then we can commit them.
