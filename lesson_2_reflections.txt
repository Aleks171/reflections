What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When I initialize a repozitory .git directory is created in the folder with other files. 
  We need it in order to use Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area offers an opportunity to choose from the files which we'd like to commit. Add them to the staging 
  area or remove if needed.
